## Will my phone support it ?

Indic keyboard supports Android version 4.1 and above (Jellybean, Kitkat and Lollipop). If you can see your language in its native script below you should be able to install and use it.

- Tap on "Set up input methods".
- Tap on the gear icon next to Indic Keyboard.
- Tap on "Languages", uncheck "User system language" and choose your language and layout from the list. 


## Why is there a warning about "collecting data"?

This warning message is a part of the Android operating system. It will appears whenever you try to enable a third party keyboard. We don't collect any data.

## What is a keyboard layout ?

Indic keyboard provides multiple "keyboard layouts". This means that you will have different  ways to type in your native language.

**Transliteration** allows you to type out words using English characters, but will automatically transform the words to your native language. For example, if you type "namaste" in English while using Devanagari transliteration keyboard, it will transform it to नमस्ते correctly.

**Inscript layout** is the standardized keyboard that Government of India came up with to cater for the majority of the languages in India. We support the full specification, and if you are already familiar with Inscript on your Desktop, it will work on the phone too.

**Phonetic keyboard** is similar to Transliteration scheme - you can type what the words sound like using English characters and it will be automatically transformed into your language.

**Compact Keyboard** allows to type Indian languages without the shift key. You can long press on the letters to get more options.

Other layouts are specific to the languages - do try them out.
